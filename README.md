# Cybersecurity-projects
## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
As organizations increasingly migrate their infrastructure to the cloud, ensuring strong security measures has become critical. Cloud environments introduce unique challenges, such as identity and access misconfigurations, data breaches, compliance risks, and evolving cyber threats. These projects focus on securing cloud architectures by leveraging industry best practices, automation, and real-time monitoring.

This cybersecurity repository contains hands-on cloud security projects designed to:

**Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in cloud environments**

**Automate security monitoring and threat detection**

**Implement access control and least privilege principles**

**Secure cloud workloads using AWS, Splunk, SIEM, and serverless security tools**
